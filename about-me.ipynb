      "Hi! My name is Rafael Aparício da Silva Cabral. I’m excited to learn because since I started working as an Occupational Safety Technician, I've always wanted the information shared in meetings to be understood in the best possible way. That’s why I used to create more visual presentations to make the topics easier to understand. In the field of data analysis, I see an opportunity to do this on an even larger scale: transforming information from countless spreadsheets into visual and impactful presentations that can influence decisions and add value to businesses. My goal for this course is: to change careers and provide a better life for my son.\n"
